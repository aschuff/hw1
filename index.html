    <h1>Me Before</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Amanda. I'm from a small town called Pelzer located in Greenville, SC. I grew up with two brothers
        and lots of animals. I graduated with my degree in Art Education from the University of South Carolina in 2012.

    <h1>Along the Way</h1>
    <p>
      Since 2013 I have been teaching elementary Art to kids from Kindergarten all the way up to 5th grade. Elementary
      was never my first choice (I really wanted to teach high school) but I saw it as an opportunity and a challenge
      so I went for it.
      <p>
        I was excited and had this feeling that I could conquer anthing that was put in front of me. However, after a
        few months Year One started to feel a little like being in a boat with a pinhole in the bottom; you just keep
        shoveling out the water just to stay afloat. As the year went on I kept my head up and stayed positive. Summer
        came and went and before I knew it I wasn't a "baby" teacher anymore. I was on to Year Two and my hopes were
        high! And then reality set in once again. Anyway, long story short, after 3 solid years I finally accepted that
        maybe it just wasn't for me.
