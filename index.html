    <h1>Hello.</h1>
    <h2>Until Now</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Amanda. I'm from a small town called Pelzer located in Greenville, SC. I graduated with my degree in Art Education from the University of South Carolina in 2012. I've lived in Charleston with my husband Todd and two cats, Teddy and Lily, for the past three years.
      </p>
    <h2>Along the Way</h2>
    <p>
      Since 2013 I have been teaching elementary Art to kids from Kindergarten all the way up to 5th grade. Elementary
      was never my first choice (I really wanted to teach high school) but I saw it as an opportunity and a challenge
      so I went for it.
      <p>
        I was excited and had this feeling that I could conquer anthing that was put in front of me. However, after a
        few months Year One started to feel a little like being in a boat with a pinhole in the bottom; you just keep
        shoveling out the water just to stay afloat. As the year went on I kept my head up and stayed positive. Summer
        came and went and before I knew it I wasn't a "baby" teacher anymore. I was on to Year Two and my hopes were
        high! And then reality set in once again. Anyway, long story short, after 3 solid years I finally accepted that
        maybe it just wasn't for me.
      </p>
    </p>
    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
    <p>
      So, here I am. Quit my teaching job. First day at The Iron Yard. And I am so excited!! I couldn't be more elated! It's been a long journey, from making the decision to go for it to getting my acceptance, but I am so looking forward to the end result. Completing The Iron Yard will be the toughest thing I've done since college but will be so rewarding at the same time. So, here's to all the good things coming my way!
